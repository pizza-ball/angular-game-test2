IDEAS

Graze based gameplay system. Grazing meter is constantly decreasing. Grazing a bullet raises it a little bit.
When maxed, the player can deploy a small space around themselves that...
 - converts all bullets to points, or
 - enables a powerful melee counter, which swats bullets in front of you back, or
 - 

Normal mode: this mechanic is never necessary. Certain bullet arrangements need to be worth more graze due to less bullets.
Hard mode: this mechanic is practically necessary, but technically not.

CODE IDEAS
